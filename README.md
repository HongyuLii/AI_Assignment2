You can run these two programs in terminal, for example >>python model-free.py

In order for the test to work, please include the test file in the same directory as the programs. 

Also please use the test file on this git repo, I've tried using a different test file but failed. The content of the test and the test from the professor are the same, in fact they are both from the professor, I couldn't figure out why the one on sakai doesn't work. 

I used a function random.choices, which is new in Python 3.6, pleased have Python 3.6 installed before running, otherwise, it will fail. 

Thank you very much!
